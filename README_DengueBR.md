# Dengue in Brazil — Data Analysis

This project analyzes dengue fever trends in Brazil using official data from the Ministry of Health (DATASUS) and IBGE population estimates.

## Objectives
- Explore historical dengue case trends (10 years)
- Compare state-level case counts and incidence rates
- Identify structural patterns linked to climate, urbanization, and immunity gaps

## Methods
- Data aggregation by year and state
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Incidence rate calculation (cases per 100,000 inhabitants)
- Data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn

## Key Insights
- Dengue cases show a clear upward trend over the last decade
- Highly populated states dominate absolute case counts
- Southern states, especially Santa Catarina, present high incidence due to recent transmission expansion

## Data Sources
- DATASUS / Ministry of Health (SINAN)
- IBGE population estimates (2023 proxy)

## Tools
Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
